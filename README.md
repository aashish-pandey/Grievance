# 💖 Mood Logger for Your Girlfriend (Or Whatever She Wants to Be Called)

This is a *"how-are-you-feeling-today?"* web app for your girlfriend.  
Because sometimes asking over text gets you left on seen, and this is way cuter.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

A pink, overly decorated, emoji-filled mood-checker designed to make your girlfriend go:  
> "Awwww 🥺 you're so cute (today)."

It lets her:
- Select a mood: 💔 Grievance, ❤️ Happy, or 🐼 Just Panda
- Write a message (yes, a long dramatic one too)
- Send it to you through a Google Apps Script webhook

---

## 🎀 Features

- Comic Sans. Because she deserves drama in style.
- Animated bow. It bounces.
- Mood-based emoji switch on the send button 💔/❤️
- Works on all modern browsers. Even if she’s using Safari.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Google Apps Script Webhook (for collecting the messages)
- Background bows. Lots of bows.

---

## 🛠 Setup

1. Replace the `scriptURL` in the JavaScript with your own Google Apps Script endpoint.
2. Upload to any static web server (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, etc.)
3. Send her the link.
4. Wait for messages. Hope for hearts. Prepare for 💔s.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Don’t forget to turn on Google Script "Deploy as Web App" permissions.
- Respect her moods. Especially 🐼 — those are the most dangerous ones.
- Do not use this during a fight unless you’re ready for a 3-paragraph essay.
